<!--    The 1976 Teton Dam failure in Idaho is a perfect example of this.-->
<!--    After efforts to plug the seepage that had started to develop, the dam-->
<!--    broke and released a wall of water flowing at more than a million cubic-->
<!--    feet per second, according to the Bureau of Reclamation’s website1. The-->
<!--    website explains, “the communities of Sugar City, Rexburg, and Wilford-->
<!--    were battered by the trees, houses, cattle and cars carried by the-->
<!--    floodwaters,” and 11 people lost their lives.<br><br>-->

<!--    It was this event that prompted the Bureau’s “Dam Safety” program to be-->
<!--    created. To aid in the development of this and other programs aimed at-->
<!--    local emergency preparation, the Evacuation Least Cost Path (ELCP) App-->
<!--    will be created. This app allows the user to first identify the hazard-->
<!--    area that is likely to be affected, using criterion that the user inputs.-->
<!--    For example, the hazard area that results from flooding due to natural-->
<!--    causes can be defined by a certain water level that the flood rises to,-->
<!--    whereas flooding due to a dam failure may be defined from the amount of-->
<!--    water released by the dam. Once a hazard area is identified, the app-->
<!--    identifies the most efficient evacuation route for areas within the-->
<!--    affected area.<br><br>-->

<!--    This app will greatly aid in emergency preparation efforts for local,-->
<!--    state, and national agencies and governments. It simplifies the process-->
<!--    for determining areas at risk and provides a valuable tool to aid in-->
<!--    defining evacuation efforts. Ultimately, the effectiveness of this app may-->
<!--    be instrumental in preserving human lives.</p>-->
